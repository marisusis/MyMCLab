<h1 style="margin: 0px;">MyMCLab</h1>
Current Version: <b>1.3.1</b><br><br>

<p>This is the source code of MyMCLab, server-side.
The main src/ directory contains an 'abstract' version of the project;
it is not bound to any API apart from the Java 8 API.
You can use this as a base for porting to another server platform.
In an attempt to make the plugin work on multiple platforms with less code repetition,
more and more parts of the code are slowly moved there.
<hr style="margin: 1em 0px;">
Only under the src/ directory you will find most of the API documented for use by third-parties.
In here you should find everything to extend to the project's API.
Sub-projects also containing sources will not be documented and should not be used when utilising this project.
<hr style="margin: 1em 0px;">
Note that you CAN compile the code yourself without purchasing the plugin,
but it would mean a lot to me if you did purchase it,
and you will receive <u>no</u> support if you have issues with compiling/reusing the code if you haven't bought it.
